go-cast is a golang library for reading and writing cast files. [Cast](https://github.com/dtzxporter/cast) is an open source container for models, animations, materials and more designed by [DTZxPorter](https://github.com/dtzxporter).

The goal of cast is to create an easy to use format for models, animations, materials, and game worlds. In addition, cast should be able to produce the same scenes in any 3d software.
